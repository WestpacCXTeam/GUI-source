> This library of icons is intended for use across all of our brands and user interfaces. They are designed to aid navigation and legibility. The use of icons purely as page embellishment is not recommended and in some cases will be off brand. These icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVGs) with PNG fallbacks for older browsers. Using SVGs ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the icons using code and also complies with WCAG AA accessibility requirements.

### Release History

	* Added new clear icons (`.icon-clear` and `.icon-clear-circle`)
* v2.0.3 - `SVG` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Updated icon SVGs to include `focusable="false"` attribute to disable focus in IE/Edge. This will ensure focus behaviour is consistent between all browsers.
		[#433](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/433)
	* Updated the Slack icon (`.icon-slack`)
* v2.0.2 - `SVG` `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Updated the transfer icon design (`.icon-transfer`)

	* Introducing our new class size naming convention of `.icon-[xsmall|small|large|xlarge]` (rather than `.icon-size-[sm|md|lg]`). This approach frees up the 'xs/sm/md/lg' abbreviations to refer solely to viewport breakpoint.
		[#360](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/360)
	* New icon designs are designed for optimal rendering for the above sizes; snapping to the pixel grid where possible
