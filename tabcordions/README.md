### Release History

* v3.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` `HTML` `JS`
	* Tabcordions have this really neat class that makes all tabs equal heights which looks really rad! Unless it doesn’t work. Then it looks bad, less rad.
		No more.
		[#237](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/237)
	* Justified tabs unjustified in the mobile breakpoint. That was deemed unjust and they now justify again! Justice served.
		[#238](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/238)
	* Scrolling can now be disabled or adjusted by an offset. If you have a fixed header and need the tabcordion to scroll a little less, NOW is your time!
		[#245](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/245)
	* We made improvements to our A11Y. Now all links come with underlines so you can tell them apart by color AND shape. Also A11Y means "accessibility" for all
		who were wondering.
		[#247](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/247)
	* One last little big thing: We added some attributes to help screenreaders to understand what tab is open. Another win for A11Y!
		[#258](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/258)
* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
* v1.0.1 - ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ `JS` `HTML`
	* We got word that using our JavaScript in dynamic DOM application was a bit... clunky. Clunky wasn’t good enough for us so we refactored all Javascript
		modules to unclunk all the things. Beware though, some JavaScript classes had to be injected to keep the modules clunk-free.
		[#140](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/140)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
