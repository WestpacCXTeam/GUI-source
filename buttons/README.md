		[#382](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/382)

	* Adjusted button text/icon gap (Note: ensure there is a space or line break between `.btn-text` and `.btn-icon` spans for correct gap width)
		[#378](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/378)

	* All block buttons and leading line button groups (`.btn-group-wrapper`) can now be stacked; top margin used for separation
	* Made block button group item widths a little more even

    [#346](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/346)
* v3.0.3 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Changed 'faint' button style background color from @color-Background to @color-Light.
		[#311](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/311)
* v3.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Resolved issue where radio/checkbox inputs were visible in dropdowns on iOS. Also resolved some minor alignment issues with radio/checkbox dropdowns.
		[#299](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/299)
* v3.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` `HTML` ~~`JS`~~
	* Link buttons did not like icons but icons liked buttons and wanted to make it work. After an intense couples therapy both now get along just fine.
		[#264](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/264)
	* When we call a button faint and soft we might as well use the muted text color to show the full submissiveness of this variation.
		[#265](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/265)
	* We found a little known behaviour difference between the HTML button tag and the HTML anchor tag. They take the same CSS but apply it differently.
		Pixel perfect as we are, this has now been fixed after a three day pixel-pushing session. This kind of work is only possible in a design system. ✊
		[#272](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/272)
* v3.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` `HTML` ~~`JS`~~
	* The dropdowns got an upgrade to uber-status. The Button-groups also got a new style for when you have a line of text preceding it. We are not sure which
		of the two we are most excited about.
		[#261](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/261)
	* We made improvements to our A11Y. Now all links come with underlines so you can tell them apart by color AND shape. Also A11Y means "accessibility" for all
		who were wondering.
		[#247](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/247)
* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Buttons can be links and links can be buttons. We are THAT progressive. It’s just when a keyboard user focuses on a link the link-button would display it’s
		text white on white background. That’s the opposite of accessibility. Tis no more!
		[#216](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/216)
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
* v1.0.3 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* The button-groups got disjointed when faced with the new system font for El Capitan. We loosened them up and stretched those tired legs and arms and now
		all joints join where they should join.
		[#191](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/191)
	* We integrated the new versions of checkboxes and radios into the dropdowns.
	* We noticed that icons in button groups were not tinting the way they should. This, too, has been laid to rest in bug-heaven.
		[#185](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/185)
* v1.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` `JS` `HTML`
	* We got word that using our JavaScript in dynamic DOM application was a bit... clunky. Clunky wasn’t good enough for us so we refactored all Javascript
		modules to unclunk all the things. Beware though, some JavaScript classes had to be injected to keep the modules clunk-free.
		[#140](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/140)
	* Differently sized buttons couldn’t handle differently sized icons. We thought differently and made it work.
		[#141](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/141)
	* We are proud to introduce a very handy(we hope) new feature for buttons. Responsive sizes. You can now resize your buttons according to a breakpoint. Now
		go off and resize those buttons.
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* All our buttons have a specific height to abide to. When you added an icon in a button however, the buttons seized the opportunity to go rouge and
		added two pixels. We sat down with them and had a heart-to-heart. Now they know better. [#131](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/131)
	* The icons, set inside a soft button (also being naughty) didn’t display in the font color which made it hard for us humans to see them. That too, was
		fixed. [#127](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/127) [#126](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/126)
	* On some handheld devices when taping and holding the button group, the active state looked cut-off and weird. Admittedly when you hold your finger on
		the screen you kind of hid the problem with your finger and it was hard for us to even find this bug but this is just another example of the extent of
		detailed work we put into this baby. [#129](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/129)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
