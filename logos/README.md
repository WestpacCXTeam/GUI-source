> Using SVGs ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the symbols using code and also complies with AA accessibility requirements.

		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
	* All SVGs now come with a unique title ID. That may not sound like much but SVGs are very particular about their individualism.
