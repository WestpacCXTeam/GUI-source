> Pagination is used to navigate within a set of related views. This element allows navigation within both finite (a set number) and infinite (unknown number) of views. Lazy-load seems to have superseded pagination, however if you are working within technical restrictions then pagination is still an acceptable option.

	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
	* On Safari, not to name and shame any browser (#SafariIsTheNewIE), elements showed some space between each other even though all other browsers totally got
		what we wanted. The elements wanted to be together as they all grew up together so we had to explain that to Safari. After a little discussion about
		the merits of a tight family even Safari couldn’t deny the cuddling.
		[#205](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/205)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
