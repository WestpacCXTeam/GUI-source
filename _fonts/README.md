> The typography system caters for our multi-brand framework allowing us to implement brand specific web typography. Due to licensing issues we currently donâ€™t use many brand specific web fonts however weâ€™re hoping to resolve this soon. The system will then help us to implement brand specific fonts very easily. Never use a web font without prior confirmation that you have the correct licence agreement in place.
