> The typography system caters for our multi-brand framework allowing us to implement brand specific web typography. Due to licensing issues we currently don’t
> use many brand specific web fonts however we’re hoping to resolve this soon. The system will then help us to implement brand specific fonts very easily.
> Never use a web font without prior confirmation that you have the correct licence agreement in place.
